The WiMuTH Framework is a framework for Lumen and EEM boundary segmentation for IVUS images with contrast, artifacts, and fuzzy regions. It features four innovative modules: WCSR, MaHS, IDC, and DFCH bridge. WiMuTH Framework achieves state-of-the-art performance over 13 previous methods on the NIRS-IVUS datasets.


The methodology and underlying principles will be elucidated initially. After that, the experimental environment will be delineated, along with the GitHub repositories of the comparative methods. Finally, the experimental outcomes will be presented.

## Method
### WCSR Module

WCSR leverages wavelet transformation to analyze the frequency domain characteristics of images, thereby enhancing model robustness against motion artifacts induced by cardiac pulsations and improving the capture of spatial information and boundary feature recognition.

### MaHS Module

### IDC Module

### DFCH bridge

### MAE-Enhanced Vascular Morphology Analysis
