The WiMuTH Framework is a framework for Lumen and EEM boundary segmentation for IVUS images with contrast, artifacts, and fuzzy regions. It features four innovative modules: WCSR, MaHS, IDC, and DFCH bridge. WiMuTH Framework achieves state-of-the-art performance over 13 previous methods on the NIRS-IVUS datasets.


First, the methodology and underlying principles will be explained. Then, the comparative methods' experimental environment and the GitHub repositories will be delineated. Finally, the experimental outcomes will be presented.

## Method
### WCSR Module

WCSR leverages wavelet transformation to analyze the frequency domain characteristics of images, thereby enhancing model robustness against motion artifacts induced by cardiac pulsations and improving the capture of spatial information and boundary feature recognition.

### MaHS Module

MaHS integrates various attention mechanisms and convolution operations to enhance the model's capability of extracting and analyzing complex vascular region features.

### IDC Module

IDC employs deep normalization and adjustment of feature maps to optimize the integrity of information during feature transfer. This minimizes information loss and thus enhances the precision and consistency of segmentation.

### DFCH bridge

DFCH bridge enhances the restoration of spatial information during the feature upsampling process by fusing multi-layer features and applying convolutions with varied dilation rates. Thus, it augments the modelâ€™s ability to capture image details, particularly at image edges and boundaries.

### MAE-Enhanced Vascular Morphology Analysis

## Installation

We run WiMuTH Framework and previous methods on a system running Ubuntu 22.04, with Python 3.9, PyTorch 2.0.0, and CUDA 11.7.
