## Overview
The WiMuTH Framework is a framework for Lumen and EEM boundary segmentation for IVUS images with contrast, artifacts, and fuzzy regions. It features four innovative modules: WCSR, MaHS, IDC, and DFCH bridge. This repo implements algorithms for the main WiMuTH Framework and those in the baseline and contains the framework's flow charts, innovation module flows, and paper implementation results.
## Create conda environment
- The environment uses Ubuntu 22.04 and pytorch 2.0.0 supported on CUDA 11.7 and python 3.9.
## Computation Requirement
- We experimented on a 24-gigabyte existing RTX 4090.
