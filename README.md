# WiMuTH-Framework
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, We are a team dedicated to the task of researching medical images 

- ðŸ”­ We're currently working on IVUS image segmentation.
- :heart_eyes: So far, we have found the SOTA framework for this mission.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to the Framework.

#### Wavelet-Integrated Multidimensional Tensorial-Harmonic Coronary Artery Reconstruction (WiMuTH) Framework consists of Adaptive Location-Aware Spatial Pathway and Guided Positional Mapping in Spatial Pathway and the key modules in the WiMuTH Framework. (a) The specific structure ofthe backbone network processes input images with subsequent feature extraction through Wavelet Convolutional Spectrum Reshapers (WCSR) and Multi-Axial Heterogeneous Synthesis (MaHS) blocks. The feature maps are then harmonized and refined by Deep Feature Convergence Harmonization (DFCH) bridges, employing techniques such as (AS)Align Split, convolutional block attention (CBA), and squeeze-and-excitation attention (SEA) for enhance feature integration. The proposed DFCH Bridge structure in skip-connection. (b) The structure of a DFCH Bridge. (c) The structure of a WCSR block. (d) The structure of MaHS module.
